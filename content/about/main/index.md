intro: |
  Transcriptomics: We use various techniques such as RNA-bulk-seq and sn/c-RNA-seq to decipher the signature of diseases and response to therapies.
  
  Proteomics: We use both targeted and untargeted proteomics to understand disease progression and biomarkers. These are usually based on mass spectrometry and other technologies.

  Epigenomics: We use various techniques to identify novel targets in cardiovascular diseases
  
  Preclinical models: We use preclinical models to capture the complexity of cardiovascular diseases, particularly diabetic cardiomyopathy. For example, mice fed a high-fat diet and injected with streptozotocin.

  Biomarkers: We reveal novel biomarkers related to clinical relevance, including infections and cancers, using various techniques (such as machine learning).
