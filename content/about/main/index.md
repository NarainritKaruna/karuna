  Transcriptomics: We use various techniques such as RNA-bulk-seq and sn/c-RNA-seq to dicipher signature of diseases and response to therapies.
  
  
  Proteomics: We use both targeted and untargeted proteomics to understand diseases progression and biomarkers. These are usually based on mass spectrometry and other technologies.
  
  
  Pre clinical models: We use pre clinical models to capture complexity of cardiovascular diseases, particularly diabetic cardiomyopathy. For example, mice fed with high fat diet and injected with streptozotocin.
